# slidenotes
This web app allows a user to upload a .pptx presentation and recieve custom created notes using openAI gpt-3. React.js is used for the frontend and the backend is built using SAM CLI with components including Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SQS, API Gateway, and Cloudwatch. A live demo is available [here](https://main.d30dqjeh84u0lr.amplifyapp.com). This is a work in progress so not all features will work at this time.
